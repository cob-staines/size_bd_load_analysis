	abstract = {Effectively planning conservation introductions involves assessing the suitability of both donor and recipient populations, including the landscape of disease risk. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused extensive amphibian declines globally and may hamper reintroduction attempts. To determine Bd dynamics in potential source populations for conservation translocations of the threatened California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) to Yosemite National Park, we conducted Bd sampling in two populations in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, U.S. A. At one of two sites, we observed lethally high Bd loads in early post-metamorphic life stages and confirmed one chytridiomycosis-induced mortality, the first such report for this species. These results informed source population site selection for subsequent R. draytonii conservation translocations. Conservation efforts aimed at establishing new populations of R. draytonii in a landscape where Bd is ubiquitous can benefit from an improved understanding of risk through disease monitoring and ex situ infection studies.},

	abstract = {Amphibians are among the vertebrate groups suffering great losses of biodiversity due to a variety of causes including diseases, such as chytridiomycosis (caused by the fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans). The amphibian metamorphic period has been identified as being particularly vulnerable to chytridiomycosis, with dramatic physiological and immunological reorganisation likely contributing to this vulnerability. Here, we overview the processes behind these changes at metamorphosis and then perform a systematic literature review to capture the breadth of empirical research performed over the last two decades on the metamorphic immune response. We found that few studies focused specifically on the immune response during the peri-metamorphic stages of amphibian development and fewer still on the implications of their findings with respect to chytridiomycosis. We recommend future studies consider components of the immune system that are currently under-represented in the literature on amphibian metamorphosis, particularly pathogen recognition pathways. Although logistically challenging, we suggest varying the timing of exposure to Bd across metamorphosis to examine the relative importance of pathogen evasion, suppression or dysregulation of the immune system. We also suggest elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the increased susceptibility to chytridiomycosis at metamorphosis and the associated implications for population persistence. For species that overlap a distribution where Bd/Bsal are now endemic, we recommend a greater focus on management strategies that consider the important peri-metamorphic period.},

	abstract = {Amphibian populations are undergoing extensive declines globally. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a primary contributor to these declines. The amphibian metamorphic stages (Gosner stages 42–46) are particularly vulnerable to a range of stressors, including Bd. Despite this, studies that explicitly examine host response to chytridiomycosis throughout the metamorphic stages are lacking. We aimed to determine how Bd exposure during the larval stages impacts metamorphic development and infection progression in the endangered Fleay’s barred frog (Mixophyes fleayi). We exposed M. fleayi to Bd during pro-metamorphosis (Gosner stages 35–38) and monitored infection dynamics throughout metamorphosis. We took weekly morphological measurements (weight, total body length, snoutvent-length and Gosner stage) and quantified Bd load using qPCR. While we observed minimal impact of Bd infection on animal growth and development, Bd load varied throughout ontogeny, with an infection load plateau during the tadpole stages (Gosner stages 35–41) and temporary infection clearance at Gosner stage 42. Bd load increased exponentially between Gosner stages 42 and 45, with most exposed animals becoming moribund at Gosner stage 45, prior to the completion of metamorphosis. There was variability in infection outcome of exposed individuals, with a subgroup of animals (n = 5/29) apparently clearing their infection while the majority (n = 21/29) became moribund with high infection burdens. This study demonstrates the role that metamorphic restructuring plays in shaping Bd infection dynamics and raises the concern that substantial Bdassociated mortality could be overlooked in the field due to the often cryptic nature of these latter metamorphic stages. We recommend future studies that directly examine the host immune response to Bd infection throughout metamorphosis, incorporating histological and molecular methods to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the observed trends.},

	abstract = {The fungal disease chytridiomycosis (causative agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd]) is a primary contributor to amphibian species declines. The morphological and physiological reorganization that occurs during amphibian metamorphosis likely increases the vulnerability of metamorphs to Bd. To address this, we exposed pro-metamorphic tadpoles of Fleay’s barred frog (Mixophyes fleayi) to Bd and sampled skin and liver sections from control and exposed animals throughout metamorphosis (Gosner stages 40, 42 and 45). We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to assess the metabolic impacts of Bd infection during the critical metamorphic stages, extracting metabolites from sampled tissues and analysing them via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometry. Most exposed animals became moribund at Gosner stage 45, while a subset seemingly cleared their infections. Metabolite abundance varied throughout development, with Gosner stage 45 samples distinct from previous stages. Clinically infected animals at Gosner stage 45 exhibited profound metabolic dysregulation (e.g., upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis and degradation) in comparison to uninfected groups (negative controls and ‘cleared’ animals). Despite showing parallels with previous metabolomic analyses of Bd-infected adult frogs, we identified variations in our results that could be attributed to the dramatic changes that characterise metamorphosis and may be driving the heightened vulnerability observed in metamorphic amphibians.},

	abstract = {Parasites and pathogens are often aggregated in a minority of susceptible hosts within a population, with a majority of individuals harboring low infection intensities. However, determining the relative importance of host traits to explain this heterogeneity is a challenge. One ecologically important pathogen is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis and has been associated with many amphibian population declines worldwide. For many hosts, post-metamorphic stages are generally more susceptible than the larval stage. Yet, examination of the effects of Bd infection at different ages within a life stage, has received little attention. This study investigated the hypothesis that recently-post-metamorphic frogs were more sensitive to chytridiomycosis than older frogs, and that sensitivity to Bd infection decreased as frogs aged. We examined this relationship with Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) and red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Age had a strong effect on susceptibility to infection, infection intensity, and survival–but not in the directions we had predicted. In both host species, an increase in age was associated with frogs becoming more susceptible to Bd infection, harboring larger infection intensities, and greater risk of mortality. This suggests that the timing of Bd exposure may influence amphibian population dynamics.},
